📊 CO₂ Emissions Analysis

🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions across different years, countries, and industry sectors. Using a dataset of 1,750 records, it provides insights into emission trends, top polluting countries, and high-emission industries.

🔍 Key Business Questions Answered:
✔ How have CO₂ emissions changed over time?
✔ Which countries contribute the most to global emissions?
✔ What are the most polluting industry sectors?

📊 Skills & Tools Used
✔ Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) → Data Processing & Visualization
✔ Jupyter Notebook → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ GitHub → Version Control & Portfolio Showcase
